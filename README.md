# Quantum Key Distribution Simulation
A simulation of the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol.

Quantum computing has increasingly entered public awareness, so it is important for people to understand what is actually meant by the terms which are used in media (e.g. quantum cryptography). This is a simplified, interactive, visual representation, focusing on approachability for those unfamiliar with the underlying maths.

This is a simulation describing the process of two correspondents generating a shared key using quantum mechanical principles in accordance with the BB84 protocol, with an eavesdropper which can be toggled active or inactive.
