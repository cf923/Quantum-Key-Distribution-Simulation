Improvement ideas:
- Label the error causing bit on the graph.
- Prevent page from reloading when button is pressed, otherwise "predict the states" section does not work (!)
- Need more quiz questions. 
- Label the x axis as bits?
- Put different sections on separate pages so that it's easier to get an overview. 
- Add references (!)
- Not sure what "resulting key" is but it should not be different to sender and receiver key. Maybe just display one final key? 

Fixed: 
- Question 3 mixes up forward slash and backslash.
