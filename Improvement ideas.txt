Improvement ideas:
- Label the error causing bit on the graph.
- Need more quiz questions. 
- Label the x axis as bits?
- Not sure what "resulting key" is but it should not be different to sender and receiver key. Maybe just display one final key? 
- Make the page more visually appealing by adding color and/or pictures. 
- Need to make simulation graph more understandable - maybe instead of associating colors with numbers in the legend, associate colors with the states explicitly (!)

Fixed: 
- Question 3 mixes up forward slash and backslash.
- Put different sections on separate pages so that it's easier to get an overview. 
- Add references (!) Note: Not sure if it makes sense to put citations in text on the page, may just leave that for poster. 
- Prevent page from reloading when button is pressed, otherwise "predict the states" section does not work (!) - The entering of predicted states does not work either, because copying a state reloads the page.
